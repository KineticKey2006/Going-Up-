      <h2>Liftoff</h2>
      <p>Spaceflight simulation is a sophisticated practice that involves replicating the experience and physics of operating a spacecraft through computer models and sometimes hardware systems. These simulations serve a wide range of purposes, from training astronauts and testing spacecraft systems to educational and research applications. By modeling real-world physical principles such as orbital mechanics, propulsion dynamics, and spacecraft controls, simulations allow engineers and operators to safely explore complex scenarios before engaging in actual missions.</p>

          <h2>Stage separation (continued)</h2>
          <p>In professional contexts, spaceflight simulation is an essential tool for mission planning and risk mitigation. Agencies like NASA, ESA, and private companies such as SpaceX use high-fidelity simulators to train crews, evaluate mission protocols, and ensure spacecraft designs perform as intended. These simulators often incorporate real-time telemetry, control interfaces, and environmental factors to create immersive, accurate experiences that mirror real conditions in space. Such simulations significantly reduce the risk of error during critical mission phases such as launch, docking, and re-entry.</p>

          <h2>Orbit (continued)</h2>
          <p>Beyond professional use, spaceflight simulators have become valuable educational tools and hobbyist platforms. Software like Orbiter, Kerbal Space Program, and FlightGear enable users to engage with the principles of astronautics in an interactive manner. These platforms foster a deeper understanding of space science and engineering, often inspiring future professionals in the field. Whether for training, testing, or learning, spaceflight simulation plays a vital role in advancing humanity's capabilities in space exploration.</p>
