        <h2>Realistic spaceflight</h2>
        <p>Realistic flight simulators aim to replicate the experience of piloting aircraft with a high degree of accuracy and technical detail. These simulations often include real-world physics, aerodynamics, authentic cockpit controls, and real-time weather data to closely mimic actual flight conditions. Players are typically required to manage navigation systems, engine functions, and proper communication protocols, making these games both educational and challenging. A prime example is Kerbal Space Program, which features a detailed global map, satellite imagery, and live traffic and weather systems. This title is widely used not only for entertainment but also for flight training and procedural practice by aspiring pilots and aviation enthusiasts.</p>

          <h2>Space combat</h2>
          <p>Space combat games focus on high-paced, action-oriented gameplay set in outer space, often involving dogfights, tactical maneuvers, and futuristic weaponry. These games emphasize reflexes, spatial awareness, and strategic decision-making during combat in a zero-gravity environment. Visual and sound design typically lean toward the cinematic, enhancing immersion in interstellar battles. One noteworthy example is Everspace 2, which offers dynamic space battles, detailed ship customization, and an expansive universe filled with hostile factions and missions. While not a strict simulation, it balances arcade-style combat with deeper mechanics to appeal to a broad range of players.</p>

          <h2>Space trading and combat</h2>
          <p>Space trading and combat games combine economic strategy with tactical spaceflight and combat elements. Players often take on the role of a pilot or entrepreneur, managing resources, trading goods between planetary systems, and upgrading ships while engaging in battles with pirates or rival factions. These games typically feature open-world or sandbox environments, allowing for non-linear gameplay and personal progression. A prominent example is Elite Dangerous, which offers a vast, persistent galaxy modeled on the Milky Way, allowing players to explore, trade, mine, and engage in combat. The game appeals to players who enjoy both strategic planning and immersive space exploration.</p>
